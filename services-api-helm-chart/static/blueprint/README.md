# Blueprint

This directory contains the Authentik blueprint YAML file, synced from `common/authentik-blueprint/`.

**Do not edit files in this directory directly.** Edit the source in `common/authentik-blueprint/`
and run `./scripts/sync-templates.py` to propagate changes.

The blueprint is generated by running the converter:

```bash
just blueprint-convert-staging
```

The generated file uses `!Env` tags to resolve deployment-specific values
(domain, client ID, client secret, etc.) from environment variables at blueprint
apply time. These environment variables are injected into the authentik pods by
the Helm chart via `values.yaml`.

**Do not edit the generated blueprint file directly.** Always regenerate it from
the staging export using the converter.
